==============
I, Rahul Bhattad, Living and working in Dubai Land, a seasoned performer with a personable, down-to-earth approach, who enjoys the daily interaction with clients and helping people achieve their property goals. My genuine love of the industry is obvious, and I tackle challenges head on and believe communication is key to successful outcome and have earned a reputation for diligence, integrity and attention to detail. Achieving a result that exceeds expectations is my main focus. The person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy, inevitable part of the process of getting to the top. Our greatest insight comes from our greatest failures, and not always from are greatest triumphs.
